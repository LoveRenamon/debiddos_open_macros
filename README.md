# Debiddos Open Macros
A bunch of presets and macros writen by [Debiddo](https://github.com/LoveRenamon) to aid his own workflow by create playermodels, custom animations and file replacements for Source Engine 2013

## Dependencies
To use this repository, you will need:

   * **[Blender 3D](https://www.blender.org) 2.80.75** *or newer* for modeling and animation with some compatible **Addon** to manipulate, import and export the necessary files.
   * *[Blender Source Tools](http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/archives)*
   * **studiomdl.exe**: I recommend use from any **Source Engine 2013** branch. Previous versions might don't work due to many macros or variables. This binary can be found at your Game's `bin` folder.


A minimum knowledge of:
  * Source Engine
  * Quake Code
  * Blender
  * Shape Key & Flex Animation
  * Euler Rotation
  * Gimbal Rotation
  * Quaternion Rotation
  * Rotations & Location Relative/Absolute Positions


> That is, if you are a **beginner**, you will basically don't understand what is here
