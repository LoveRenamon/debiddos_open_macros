## .vrd
files with the `.vrd` extension are used in the `$ProceduralBone` parameter, which works as `Helper Bones` for Valve. Its application is very similar to **`Drivers`** from **Blender**.

## vars.qci
contains variables to optimize time and creation of vProjects.
The compiler will load just the first parameter for each variable, and unlike many other languages ​​and scripts, it can only contain a single value/string.

### parameters
 Each _(QC Command)_ parameter can be found in [Valve Developers](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Category:QC_Commands) for better understanding.
