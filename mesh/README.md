   Note that **[FACS.dmx]()** and **[HWM.dmx]()** are files that contain only facial expression rules.


### FACS.dmx
   It follows the system of **[Facial Action Coding System]()** to map the easy expressions. this is the fastest method of making facial expressions in Source, and the most difficult to customize.

### HWM.dmx
   It follows the new **[Hardware Morph]()** pattern for moving parts of the mesh, this brings it closer to current animation standards. It's super versatile and allows **[normals]()** to be realigned, better support for **[wrinkle maps]()**, **[corrective shapes]()**.  
   Super easy to customize, but it takes a lot of time positioning each shape/flex.
